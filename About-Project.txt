2. **Components (`components/`)**: Divided by feature for better reusability and modularity.
3. **Custom Hooks (`hooks/`)**: Manages state and logic for specific parts of the app.
4. **Pages (`pages/`)**: Corresponds to different routes in the app.
5. **Routes (`routes/`)**: Organized routing in a single file for cleaner navigation.
6. **Styles (`styles/`)**: Centralized styling to maintain design consistency.
7. **Utils (`utils/`)**: Shared utility functions and constants.

Tech Stack Overview:

Build Tool: Vite for fast builds and development.
Language: JavaScript (for simplicity).

2. Track Total Energy Usage Across Devices
Backend
Update the energyUsage field dynamically whenever energy is consumed by a device.
Link energy usage from devices to the budget.
Steps:

Device Energy Usage Tracking:
Every device logs its energy usage periodically.
Aggregate Usage:
Sum the energy usage of all devices linked to the user's active budget.

Front-End
Display a progress bar or chart showing the current usage vs. limit.
Sample Progress Display:

Energy Usage: 120 kWh
Limit: 300 kWh
Progress Bar: (40% used)


3. Trigger Alerts When the Budget Limit is Exceeded
Backend
Add logic to compare energyUsage with energyLimit.
When usage exceeds the limit, set the alerts field to true and notify the user.
Front-End
Show a warning banner or modal when the user logs in if the budget is exceeded.
4. Store Historical Budgets and Usage Data for Reporting
Backend
Maintain a history of budgets and their usage data.
Use a schema like:
Front-End
Add a "Budget History" section showing:
Previous budgets
Periods
Limits vs. usage
Example Table:

Period	Limit (kWh)	Usage (kWh)	Status	Alerts
Jan 2025	300	320	Exceeded	Yes
Dec 2024	300	290	Met	No
Features Integration Workflow:
Backend Logic:

Create endpoints for budget creation, usage tracking, and history retrieval.
Add checks for alert triggers.
Front-End Implementation:

Add input fields for setting limits.
Display current usage vs. limit visually.
Show alerts and historical data.
Automation:

Use a cron job to reset monthly budgets and store old budgets as history.
