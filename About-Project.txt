A) Overview:
A platform for homeowners to track and optimize energy consumption across their smart devices.

B) Core Features:
1) Device Monitoring: Track energy usage of individual appliances.
2) Budgeting: Set monthly energy budgets and get alerts when exceeding them.
3) Suggestions: AI-powered tips to reduce energy consumption.
4) Reports: Weekly/monthly reports with insights and trends.

C) Unique Aspect:
Addresses sustainability concerns with a focus on energy efficiency and cost-saving.


D) Why It's Relevant:
1) Real-World Problem: With increasing energy costs and environmental concerns, tools that optimize home energy consumption are not just relevant but essential.
2) Demand: IoT and sustainability are rapidly growing fields. Companies working on green tech and smart devices will find this project impressive.

E) Key Features to Highlight:
1) Energy Usage Tracking: Demonstrates integration with APIs or external devices for real-time monitoring.
2) Budgeting: Incorporates logic to alert users when exceeding energy budgets.
3) AI-Powered Suggestions: Offers actionable insights, highlighting advanced backend and API usage.
4) Visual Reports: Data visualization shows your ability to present complex data in a user-friendly way.


F) Project Roadmap
1) Define the Core Features
i) Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
*) User Authentication:
--- Secure login/signup system using JWT or sessions.
** Energy Usage Monitoring:
--- Simulate device data with mock energy consumption values.
--- Display real-time energy usage for individual devices.
*** Budget Tracking:
--- Allow users to set monthly energy budgets and receive alerts if exceeded.
**** Reports and Visualization:
--- Create graphs and charts (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js) to show energy trends.
***** AI-Powered Suggestions:
--- Provide recommendations to reduce energy usage.


G) Future Enhancements:
1) Integration with Smart Devices: Use APIs or dummy IoT data for real-world simulation.
2) Multi-User Accounts: Share energy management data within households.
3) Mobile Optimization: Make it fully responsive for mobile devices.

H) Set Up the Tech Stack
1) Frontend:
i) HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the basic structure and styling.
ii) React: Component-based UI framework for dynamic interfaces.
iii) React Query: Efficient server state management.
Bootstrap: For consistent styling and responsiveness.

2) Backend:
1) Node.js: Server-side runtime for handling requests.
2) Express.js: Web framework for building REST APIs or GraphQL endpoints.

3) Database:
1) MongoDB: Store user profiles, device data, energy usage logs, and budgets.

4) Tools and Libraries:
1) Chart.js: For visualizing energy trends.
2) JWT: For secure authentication.
3) Axios: For API calls between frontend and backend.
